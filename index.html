            Germany <br>

            Germany is a federal parliamentary republic with a head of government - the chancellor - and a head of state
            - the president - whose primary responsibilities are representative. The country comprises 16 states which
            each have their own constitution and are largely autonomous regarding their internal organisation. 3 of
            these are city-states: Bremen, Berlin and Hamburg.

            Luxembourg diversified and is now best known for its status as Europe's most powerful investment management
            centre.
